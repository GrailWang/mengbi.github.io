Hi there!
This is Grail Wang from
Faculty of Arts and Sciences & School of Mathematical Sciences,
Beijing Normal University.

I am currently doing my math study, and at the same time trying doing 
some (all the) "applied mathematics". (see in details below : )

I have no MBTI personalities to label me. 
If I have to, I would like to describe myself as "IMSB".

Rigorous logic and morals is the highest pricipal for me
to do all things and make all decisions.
But I keep battling stereotypes like odd mathematicians and girls can't do math well.

Dad jokes never leaves me.

Casual as I might seem, I am indeed serious about all my passions.
I love interacting with people even though I am not good at starting a topic lol

Randomly I do some crazy stuff that has nothing to do with my profession and shock many around.
